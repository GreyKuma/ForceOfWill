 * {@link RecyclerView.Adapter} class that is useful whenever the data you're displaying is held in a list. This is
 * almost always the case so you will typically want to extend {@link ListAdapter}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ListAdapter} is parametrized by the type of the list it contains. Here it's just strings, but it can be
 * any other class as well.
 * <p>
 * The second parameter is the {@link ViewHolder}, which is ususally implemented as a nested class of the adapter.
